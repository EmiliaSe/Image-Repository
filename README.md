##Image repository

small project creating a searchable image repository

-Using a simple web interface to allow users to view curated collection of images
-storage is a mySQL database that stores the path to the image that is stored in the filesystem. In a larger implementation, the images would be stored with some cloudservice and the DB would store the path to access the files
-images were sourced from unsplashed.com
-using php to connect the web interface to the database
